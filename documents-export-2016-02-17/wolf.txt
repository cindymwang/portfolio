The Girl Who Cried Wolf:

by Aesop Cindy

A shepherd-girl, who watched a flock of sheep near a village, brought out the villagers three or four times by crying out, "Wolf! Wolf!" and when her neighbors came to help her, laughed at them for their pains.

Now if you apply this story to the corporate tech world, it's a girl who's crying that the UX is a painpoint and no one takes her seriously...

and then when Microsoft 8 got released the shepherd-girl laughed all the way to the grave.

This past weekend, I had the pleasure of speaking at the Southeast Women in Computing Conference where I created a dream presentation that combined several of my favorite topics: women in tech, ux design, and fairy tales. 

The original tale by Aesop goes, "A shepherd-girl, who watched a flock of sheep near a village, brought out the villagers three or four times by crying out, "Wolf! Wolf!" and when her neighbors came to help her, laughed at them for their pains."

The modified version by Cindy goes, "A tech girl, who worked with a group of programmers, brought out the coders three or four times by crying out, "UX! UX!" 

....because somehow Microsoft 8 got released and she laughed all the way to the grave.
